1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search.
 What's the maximum number of steps it will take ?
    ==> O(log2(128)) = 7 

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now ?
    ==> O(log2(256) = 8

1.3 You have a name, and youe want to find the person's phone number in the phone book.
    ==> O(log2(n)

1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the person's name in the phone book,
 but you have to search through the entire book.
    ==> O(n) 'linear search'

1.5 You want to read all the numbers in phone book.
    ==> O(n) 'linear search'

1.6 You need to read the number of just the As 
    ==> O(n) 'linear search'
